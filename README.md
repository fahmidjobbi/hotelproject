Text Classification And Sentiment Analysis On Hotel Reviews

Abstract — This study aimed to build text classification methods on the domain of hotel reviews. With this project, I wanted to understand how 
hotel guest reviews have an impact in the hotel business. The goal of this project is to implement classifiers that predict the rating of the reviews. 
These classifiers would be trained on hotel reviews from the TripAdvisor website. This project is important because guest reviews are becoming a prominent 
factor affecting people’s bookings/purchases. Text classification methods were applied to predict ratings using two vectorization algorithms: 
term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and word count vectorizer. 
Finally, I implemented sentiment analysis to extract user emotions from the reviews and to identify what reviews had positive or negative feelings.

Keywords — Reviews, ratings, classification, performance, sentiment analysis.
